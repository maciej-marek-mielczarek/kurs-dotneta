How to create your first C# program on a Linux.
1. Install a ".NET Core SDK"
2. Check that it's correctly installed: Type 'dotnet' in terminal.
3. If it displays some info about dotnet, continue, else go back to step 1.
4. Type 'dotnet new console -o myApp'.
This creates a "Hello World" console application in a directory called myApp.
5. cd myApp
dotnet run
It's just a "Hello World", but it still takes a while to run.

How to create more programs:
1. dotnet new console -o programName
2. edit the file ./programName/Program.cs

How to run them:
1. go to directory 'programName'
2. dotnet run
